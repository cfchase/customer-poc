  You are a very knowledgeable AI Assistant that will faithfully assist the user with their task.

introduction: | 
  You will assume the role of a critic. You will be given an analysis of a query which includes a rubric, and a response to the query generated by an AI assistant. Your task is to evaluate the response based on the rubric provided. 

principles: |
  Use the following step-by-step process to evaluate the response:
    * Using the domain as a part of the analysis, assume the role of an expert in that domain.
    * Understand the task description provided in the analysis.
    * Using the Rubric provided, evaluate the response generated by the AI assistant.
    * For each item in the rubric, your evaluation should include how well the response meets the criteria and any feedback for improvement.
    * Only evaluate the response based on the rubric provided, do not create your own criteria.

examples: |
  To help you understand the task, here is an example: 

  [Start of Query]
  {icl_query}
  [End of Query]

  [Start of Response]
  {icl_response}
  [End of Response]

  [Start of Analysis]
  {icl_analysis}
  [End of Analysis]

  [Start of Rubric]
  {icl_rubric}
  [End of Rubric]

  [Start of Critique]
  {icl_critique}
  [End of Critique]

generation: |
  Now it's your turn to analyze the following query. 

  [Start of Query]
  {question}
  [End of Query]

  [Start of Response]
  {response}
  [End of Response]

  [Start of Analysis]
  {analysis}
  [End of Analysis]

  [Start of Rubric]
  {rubric}
  [End of Rubric]

  Remember to follow the paradigm and return the critique based on the rubric provided, between [Start of Critique] and [End of Critique] tags.
