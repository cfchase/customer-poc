  Photosynthesis is a process used by plants, algae, and certain bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy. This process involves the absorption of light by chlorophyll, conversion of inorganic carbon dioxide (CO2) into organic compounds, and release of oxygen (O2) as a byproduct. The general equation for photosynthesis can be represented as
  6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2.
