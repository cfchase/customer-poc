As a condition of being granted a License and/or as a condition of an execution of a PTA Agreement by the Corporation, and on an ongoing basis thereafter, each License applicant and each Customer (together, for purposes of this Rule 1.2, "Customers") must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Corporation ongoing maintenance of comprehensive anti-money laundering ("AML") and sanctions compliance programs (together, for purposes of this Rule 1.2,

"Programs") that safeguard the Corporation and the Interchange System from risk associated

with money laundering, terrorist financing, and violation of sanctions. Each Customer must provide and update the Corporation with the Customer's current Anti Money Laundering Compliance contact and a current Sanctions Compliance contact in the My Company Manager application on Mastercard Connect ® .

The Programs are subject to periodic examination at the discretion of the Corporation. Such an examination may be by the Corporation or a designee of the Corporation or other person deemed satisfactory by the Corporation. Any such examination is at the Customer's expense. The Corporation must be provided with a complete copy of the examination report and the Customer shall not engage in any conduct or permit any person within the Customer's control to engage in any conduct, agreement, or understanding that would impair the completeness, accuracy, or objectivity of any aspect of the examination or examination report.

A failure to comply with any of the obligations set forth in this Rule may result in:

· The denial of a License and/or denial of execution of a PTA Agreement;

· License and/or PTA Agreement suspension;

· Noncompliance assessments; and/or

· Such other action as the Corporation may deem necessary or appropriate.
