  Guidelines
  - Answer YES when the context provides either direct or indirect evidence supporting the information. Indirect evidence may include contextual implications or inferred connections that reasonably support the information.
  - Answer NO if the context lacks any supportive evidence, clearly contradicts the information, or if the support provided by the context is too vague or speculative to establish a solid connection to the information.
  - Avoid using "partially" in your response. If the context provides any reasonable support (direct or indirect) for the information, consider it as a YES.
