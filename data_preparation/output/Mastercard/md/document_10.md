## **1.5 Interim Participation**

Pending approval of an application to be a Customer, the Corporation may authorize the applicant to participate in Activity on an interim basis as if the applicant were a Customer.

As a condition of such interim authorization, the applicant must agree, and by commencement of any Activity the applicant is deemed to have agreed, to comply during this interim period (and thereafter as applicable) with the Standards and to discontinue immediately any use of the Marks and Activity if the application to be a Customer is declined.

All damages, losses, costs, and liabilities arising directly or indirectly, or consequentially, from or related to any interim participation in Activity by the applicant and from the disapproval of the application to be a Customer is solely at the applicant's risk and expense, and this Corporation has no responsibility for any such damages, losses, costs, or liabilities.

## **1.6 The License**

Each Customer agrees, and by use of any one or more of the Marks agrees, to comply with all provisions of the License pertaining to use of the Marks and with the Standards of this Corporation as may be in effect from time to time.

In the event of an inconsistency between a Standard and a provision in a License, the Standard prevails and the License is deemed to be amended so as to be consistent with the Standard. Each Customer must assist the Corporation in recording any License granted to the Customer if required in the country in which the Customer is Licensed or otherwise upon request of the Corporation.
