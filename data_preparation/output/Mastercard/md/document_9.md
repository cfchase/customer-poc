The Corporation may condition Participation, the grant of any License, or the conduct of Activity on compliance by the Customer with special conditions, such as the establishment of escrow arrangements, the delivery of letters of credit, or other arrangements that the Corporation deems necessary or appropriate to maintain the integrity of Mastercard and/or the Interchange System, including but not limited to conditions imposed pursuant to Mastercard Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions Requirements.

The Corporation has the right at any time to require that a Customer enter into a security arrangement with the Corporation. If a Customer does not enter into a security arrangement with the Corporation that is satisfactory to the Corporation, the Corporation has the right at any time to collect from the Customer, in addition to any amount otherwise due and payable by the Customer to the Corporation or to other Customers, such additional amount from the Customer as collateral as the Corporation deems appropriate. The Corporation has the right to collect any such additional amount by any means available to the Corporation including by way of example and not limitation:

**1** By taking any funds deposited by any persons from any account that the Corporation is authorized to draw upon for any purpose.

**2** By taking any funds due to such Customer from other Customers.

**3** By taking any funds being paid by such Customer to other Customers.

In each case in which the Corporation takes any such collateral, the Corporation has the right to take ownership of all or any part of such collateral (such as by placing funds taken in an account

in the Corporation's name as a secured party) and to apply such collateral as payment toward any obligation of the Customer in accordance with the Standards.

Each Customer hereby appoints and authorizes the Corporation to act as the Customer's attorney and agent for any and all purposes in connection with the filing, recording, or other perfecting of the Corporation's rights under the Standards. This Rule constitutes a security agreement between each Customer and the Corporation, and vests in the Corporation a security interest in any collateral collected as provided in these Standards, granted contemporaneously in exchange and as a condition for the continuation of the Customer's Participation and Licenses.
