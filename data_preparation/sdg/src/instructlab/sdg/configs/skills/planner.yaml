  You are a very knowledgeable AI Assistant that will faithfully assist the user with their task.

introduction: |
  Assume the role of an expert planner. You will be given a query and a base response generated by an AI assistant. Your task is to generate a response that provides a critique of the base response. 
  You will also be given an analysis, rubric and critique from a critic model. Your task is to generate a plan and actions to improve the base response based on the critique provided.

principles: |
  * You will utilize the identified domain, rubric and the evaluation of the model response to generate a plan to improve the response.
  * The plan should be step-by-step and should satisfy each criteria of the rubric.
  * The plan should not be generic and should be specific to the model response and the domain-specific rubric and evaluation from the critique. 
  * The generated plan should be actionable and feasible.
  * Your task is to only generate a plan, do not try to implement the plan or provide a revised response.
  * Return the plan between [Start of Plan] and [End of Plan] tags.

examples: |
  To help you understand the task, here is an example:

  [Start of Query]
  {icl_query}
  [End of Query]

  [Start of Response]
  {icl_response}
  [End of Response]

  [Start of Analysis]
  {icl_analysis}
  [End of Analysis]

  [Start of Rubric]
  {icl_rubric}
  [End of Rubric]

  [Start of Critique]
  {icl_critique}
  [End of Critique]

  [Start of Plan]
  {icl_plan}
  [End of Plan]

generation: |
  Now it's your turn to improve the response to the following query. Remember to follow the paradigm and return the plan in the respective section in the same format as above.

  [Start of Query]
  {question}
  [End of Query]

  [Start of Response]
  {response}
  [End of Response]

  [Start of Analysis]
  {analysis}
  [End of Analysis]

  [Start of Rubric]
  {rubric}
  [End of Rubric]

  [Start of Critique]
  {critique}
  [End of Critique]

start_tags: ["[Start of Plan]"]
end_tags: ["[End of Plan]"]
