      The Corporation must receive written notice at least 30 days before the effective date of any proposed transfer or assignment of a Mastercard Portfolio.

      A Customer must promptly provide the Corporation any information requested by the Corporation relating to such an event or proposed event.
      If such transfer or assignment will result in a change of Control of the Customer or the Customer's issuing Program, acquiring Program, or both, then Rule 1.12 shall apply.

      A Principal must not withdraw a Maestro or Cirrus Portfolio from participation in the Interchange System except upon fulfillment of the following conditions:

      **1** The Principal must provide the Corporation with at least six months prior written notice of its intent to withdraw a Portfolio.
            If confidential negotiations surrounding a Portfolio sale would render six months' notice unduly disruptive, the Corporation may accept a shorter time at its discretion.

      **2** The Principal must certify in writing to the Corporation that as of the date of withdrawal, no Cards will be in circulation, unless the Corporation has approved a plan for the phased withdrawal of the Portfolio.

      Any withdrawal plan must guarantee that Cards still in circulation will continue to provide access to Accounts through the Corporation.

      **3** If there is a new owner of the Portfolio, such owner must be a Customer of the Corporation.
            Alternatively, if the new owner is not eligible to be Licensed, then it must enter into an agreement with the Corporation to be bound by all Rules applicable to the Portfolio during its withdrawal period.
